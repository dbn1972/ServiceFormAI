## 1. Quality Philosophy

Quality is not “bug count after build.”  
Quality is the product’s demonstrated ability to behave correctly, consistently, safely, and understandably across supported devices, themes, data conditions, and release scenarios.

### Quality principles
- module quality must be explicit
- device coverage must be intentional
- contract drift must be prevented
- UI behavior and backend behavior must match
- release confidence must be evidence-based
- critical flows must be automated where feasible
- exploratory testing remains necessary for edge cases

---

## 2. Quality Coverage Model

The platform QA model must cover the following layers:

- unit and component validation
- module functional validation
- API contract validation
- schema/data integrity validation
- frontend integration validation
- responsive/device validation
- accessibility validation
- dark mode/theme validation where applicable
- cross-browser validation
- end-to-end business journey validation
- release regression validation
- operational/recovery validation for high-risk areas

---

## 3. Test Environment Matrix

The product must be validated in environments representing the supported user base.

### 3.1 Viewport classes
- Mobile portrait
- Mobile landscape
- Small tablet
- Large tablet
- Laptop
- Desktop
- Large desktop / widescreen

### 3.2 Device classes

### 3.4 Theme classes
Where the product supports themes or dark mode:
- light mode
- dark mode
- tenant theme variation
- high-contrast/accessibility-sensitive combinations where relevant

---

## 4. Mobile / Tablet / Desktop Validation Standard

The QA team must validate that the product behaves correctly on each supported environment class.

### 4.1 Mobile checks
- navigation remains usable
- forms remain legible and completable
- buttons/touch targets remain usable
- fixed headers/footers do not block key actions
- tables degrade appropriately
- dialogs and drawers fit viewport
- scroll behavior remains stable
- no clipped text or inaccessible actions

### 4.2 Tablet checks
- split layouts remain readable
- navigation adapts appropriately
- data-heavy screens remain usable
- modal widths and table widths remain controlled
- form and wizard flows remain usable in portrait and landscape

### 4.3 Desktop checks
- wide layouts do not become sparse or unreadable
- data tables remain aligned and usable
- filters, side panels, and overlays do not collide
- keyboard interactions remain correct
- large-screen spacing and hierarchy remain intentional

---

## 5. Responsive and Layout Testing

Responsive QA must include:

- breakpoint transitions
- text wrapping
- container overflow
- clipping and truncation
- grid and flex behavior
- sticky headers/footers
- drawer/sidebar behavior
- modal/dialog sizing
- table behavior across widths
- empty/error/loading state layout
- chart or dashboard layout if applicable

### Responsive failure classes
- hidden critical actions
- overlapping controls
- off-screen modals
- table content unusable
- clipped validation messages
- broken primary CTA visibility
- unsafe destructive action placement

---

## 6. Schema and Data Validation Standard

Every module with persisted data must undergo schema and data QA.

### 6.1 Schema checks
- required fields defined correctly
- optional fields behave correctly
- defaults behave as intended
- enum/state values are valid and documented
- timestamps, tenant references, and version fields exist where required
- migrations are reversible/recoverable where required
- invalid inputs are rejected safely

### 6.2 Data integrity checks
- create/update/delete behavior correct
- soft delete vs hard delete correct
- cross-service references use approved IDs
- tenant scoping preserved
- retention/lifecycle rules respected
- audit metadata preserved
- rollback/restore does not corrupt state

### 6.3 Schema regression checks
Every schema change must be tested for:
- migration success
- compatibility with older data
- API impact
- reporting/read-model impact
- rollback implications

---

## 7. API Contract and Integration Validation

### 7.1 API coverage
Each API must be validated for:
- happy path
- permission failure
- validation failure
- not found cases
- rate limit behavior where relevant
- idempotency where relevant
- tenant scoping
- audit behavior for mutations
- pagination/sorting/filtering correctness

### 7.2 Contract validation
API contracts must be tested for:
- request schema conformance
- response schema conformance
- error envelope consistency
- version behavior
- backward compatibility where applicable

### 7.3 Integration quality
Test:
- frontend ↔ API alignment
- service-to-service contract stability
- webhook/event payload behavior
- plugin/event hook behavior where applicable
- timeout/retry behavior
- correlation ID propagation

---

## 8. Frontend Integration and UI Behavior Testing

Frontend integration QA must validate:

- API state rendering
- loading states
- empty states
- success states
- error states
- retry behavior
- optimistic vs confirmed updates where relevant

- role/permission-aware visibility
- disabled state correctness
- hover/focus/selected states
- session-expiry handling
- stale-data refresh handling

### CSS / UI quality checks
- spacing consistency
- typography hierarchy
- color/token consistency
- alignment
- icon usage
- border/shadow/radius consistency
- z-index/layering correctness
- layout stability
- animation consistency
- print CSS where relevant

---

## 9. Module-by-Module Quality Model

Every product module must have a dedicated quality checklist.

### Required module QA template

For each module, define:

- module name

---

## 12. Automation Strategy

### 12.1 What to automate first
- core auth/login flows
- top admin journeys
- top end-user journeys
- API contract tests

- end-to-end tests
- visual regression tests
- contract/schema tests
- migration tests
- smoke tests for release validation

### 12.3 Manual testing remains required for
- exploratory UX issues
- complex responsive edge cases
- accessibility nuance
- theme/branding exceptions
- plugin-induced UI regressions
- uncommon operational failure scenarios

---

## 13. Release Exit Criteria

A release must not ship unless:

- critical user journeys pass
- module-level blocking defects are zero
- API contract regressions are zero
- schema migrations validated successfully
- responsive smoke coverage passed
- mobile/tablet/desktop baseline passed
- dark mode/theme regressions reviewed where relevant
- accessibility blockers are zero
- security-sensitive regressions are zero
- installation/upgrade regressions are zero where relevant
- required documentation/test evidence is attached

### Severity guidance
- Critical: blocks release
- High: blocks release unless explicitly approved
- Medium: may ship with documented acceptance
- Low: backlog candidate

---

## 14. Quality Definition of Done

A module or feature is only done when:

- functional scenarios are defined
- API behavior is verified
- schema impact is tested

- responsive/device coverage is defined
- dark mode/theme impact is tested if applicable
- accessibility impact is reviewed
- automation coverage is added where appropriate
- manual exploratory checklist is completed
- release-blocking risks are known
- documentation is updated

---

- establish module QA template
- define viewport/device/browser matrix
- add core auth/admin/API tests
- define schema migration test workflow

### Phase 2
- add responsive smoke suite
- add theme/dark mode regression suite

## Final Principle

A world-class product is not only built correctly.  
It is **proven correct across devices, schemas, APIs, modules, themes, and release conditions**.

Quality must be visible, structured, repeatable, and enforced module by module.
