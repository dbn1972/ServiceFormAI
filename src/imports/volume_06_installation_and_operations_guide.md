Prepared: 23 April 2026
Status: Draft baseline specification

## Purpose

This document provides a formal specification for the product area named in the title. It is intended to be used by product, design, engineering, security, operations, legal, partner, and customer-facing teams as an implementation and governance baseline.

## Document structure

1. Guide purpose and supported deployment models
1. Prerequisites and environment assumptions
1. Installation flows
1. Bootstrap and first-run configuration
1. Adapter configuration reference
1. Post-install validation and readiness checks
1. Operations model and daily runbook expectations
1. Backup, recovery, and disaster procedures
1. Upgrade and rollback guidance
1. Troubleshooting and support boundaries
# 1. Guide purpose and supported deployment models

This guide defines how to install, bootstrap, validate, operate, upgrade, and recover the product across managed SaaS-adjacent, private cloud, and self-hosted deployment modes. Installation is treated as a first-class product experience.

- Supported modes: managed SaaS reference, private cloud, self-hosted, source-download or enterprise install where licensed.
- The installation guide must always be versioned and aligned to the supported compatibility matrix.
- Operators must be able to validate required adapters before system activation.
# 2. Prerequisites and environment assumptions

- Supported infrastructure, network routes, TLS posture, secrets model, runtime images, and storage assumptions must be documented.
- Operators must know whether the deployment is single-region, multi-region, or restricted-network before installation.
- Any unsupported topology or adapter combination must fail at validation time, not after production data enters the system.
# 3. Installation flows

1. Review deployment model and compatibility matrix.
1. Provision required infrastructure and secrets.
1. Run install or bootstrap command/UI/API.
1. Validate adapters: CDN, database, object storage, cache, queue.
1. Create initial admin identity and security baseline.
1. Run migrations and service health checks.
1. Complete post-install validation and handoff to operational monitoring.
# 4. Bootstrap and first-run configuration

- CDN: base URL, asset routing, caching and invalidation expectations.
- Database: choose MySQL or PostgreSQL, configure TLS, pool, credentials, migrations.
- Object storage: configure S3 or S3-compatible endpoint, region, bucket policy, encryption, lifecycle settings.
- Cache: configure Redis endpoint, TLS, namespaces, and eviction compatibility.
- Queue: choose SQS, Kafka, or RabbitMQ and validate full connectivity and dead-letter support.
# 5. Adapter configuration reference

# 6. Post-install validation and readiness checks

- All services healthy and reporting version/build metadata.
- Admin login, MFA/SSO baseline, and tenant context validation successful.
- Audit trail writes, cache behavior, object storage read/write, and queue round-trip test successful.
- Critical background jobs, notifications, and plugin/theme services disabled by default unless intentionally enabled.
- Monitoring, tracing, and alert routing verified before go-live.
# 7. Operations model and daily runbook expectations

- Every service requires a runbook covering dashboards, dependencies, common incidents, rollback steps, and escalation path.
- Daily or routine operations include health review, backlog review, queue lag review, failed job review, and audit of privileged actions.
- Support tooling must respect least privilege, explicit tenant selection, and temporary elevation policy.
- Self-hosted support boundaries must clearly distinguish product defect, operator misconfiguration, and unsupported environment issues.
# 8. Backup, recovery, and disaster procedures

- Backups must include system-of-record stores and essential configuration required for recovery.
- Recovery procedures must be tested, not merely documented.
- Restore workflows must specify expected data freshness, tenant impact, and required post-restore validation.
- Disaster procedures must define RPO, RTO, regional failover assumptions, and operator responsibilities.
# 9. Upgrade and rollback guidance

- Every release must publish upgrade notes, migration notes, known incompatibilities, and rollback expectations.
- Self-hosted upgrades must define supported source versions, plugin/theme compatibility expectations, and queue adapter migration notes where relevant.
- Schema migrations must be observable, testable, and recoverable or reversible as appropriate.
- Unsafe in-place changes must be explicitly flagged and gated.
# 10. Troubleshooting and support boundaries

- Troubleshooting guidance must cover auth, DB connectivity, object storage, Redis, queue adapters, plugin runtime, and theme publishing issues.
- Install failures must capture structured diagnostics without leaking secrets.
- The guide must define what the product team supports versus what remains operator-owned in self-hosted or private-cloud deployments.
- Emergency support access requires break-glass approval and audit.
