# Volume 7
Plugin and Theme Extension Specification

Governed extension model for plugins, themes, marketplaces, lifecycle, security, packaging, and deployment.

Version 1.0
Prepared: 23 April 2026
Status: Draft baseline specification

## Purpose

This document provides a formal specification for the product area named in the title. It is intended to be used by product, design, engineering, security, operations, legal, partner, and customer-facing teams as an implementation and governance baseline.

## Document structure

1. Executive extension model
1. Extension principles and supported categories
1. Plugin architecture and runtime boundaries
1. Theme architecture and token model
1. Manifest, packaging, and compatibility
1. Extension points and event hooks
1. Deployment, enablement, and rollback
1. Permission, security, and sandbox policy
1. Marketplace and distribution governance
1. Developer tooling and support model
# 1. Executive extension model

The platform supports safe extensibility through official plugin and theme systems. Extensions are product features, not loopholes around platform rules. All extension mechanisms must preserve tenant isolation, service ownership, upgrade safety, legal discoverability, and supportability.

# 2. Extension principles and supported categories

- Extensions must be permissioned, versioned, auditable, and reversible.
- Supported plugin categories include UI extensions, workflow hooks, event handlers, integration connectors, validation plugins, reporting/export plugins, and developer tooling plugins.
- Supported theme capabilities include token-based branding, assets, typography within approved limits, and product/public-site theming layers.
- Undocumented extension by side effect is prohibited.
# 3. Plugin architecture and runtime boundaries

- Plugins must run in an approved isolated model such as sandbox, extension host, sidecar worker, or remote callback architecture.
- Plugins may only use published APIs, extension hooks, events, or SDK contracts.
- Plugins must not directly query arbitrary service databases, bypass policy, or mutate another service's schema.
- Crash containment, network egress policy, resource quotas, and tenant scope enforcement are mandatory runtime concerns.
# 4. Theme architecture and token model

- Themes must be token-based and versioned.
- Theming scopes may include platform default, tenant theme, public website theme, and portal-specific theme where supported.
- Protected zones include security-critical UX, legal footer discoverability, warnings, auth cues, and audit visibility cues.
- Theme preview, approval, publish, and rollback must be supported.
# 5. Manifest, packaging, and compatibility

Every plugin and theme package must declare a formal manifest so compatibility and approval can be automated.

# 6. Extension points and event hooks

- Services that support extension must publish explicit hook catalogs, for example before-create, after-create, validation, export, workflow transition, notification, or UI slot hooks.
- Event subscriptions must be documented, versioned, permissioned, and observable.
- Queue or event subscriptions by plugins must only use approved contracts and must not connect directly to internal topics unless the platform explicitly supports that model.
# 7. Deployment, enablement, and rollback

1. Build and package extension with signed or checksum-verifiable artifact.
1. Upload or register package in approved registry.
1. Run compatibility and policy validation.
1. Review required permissions and support ownership.
1. Enable in approved environment or tenant scope.
1. Monitor health, failures, and audit records.
1. Disable or roll back safely when required.
# 8. Permission, security, and sandbox policy

- Plugins must request only the permissions they need and those permissions must be revocable.
- Secret access must be scoped, approved, and auditable; unrestricted platform secrets are prohibited.
- Themes may not remove privacy, legal, or security disclosures.
- All new extension points require architecture, security, product, and support review.
# 9. Marketplace and distribution governance

- If a marketplace exists, publisher identity, package review, compatibility status, support ownership, and takedown/revocation process must be defined.
- Customers must be able to see publisher identity, required permissions, supported versions, and removal options.
- Emergency extension disablement or revocation must be possible in a controlled, auditable manner.
# 10. Developer tooling and support model

- An official SDK or framework must exist for plugin development, packaging, local testing, and compatibility checks.
- Theme tooling should include token validation, preview, accessibility checks, and rollback support.
- Developer portal content must include sample extensions, manifest examples, version policy, and support boundaries.
- Support teams must be able to identify whether an issue is platform-native, extension-induced, or caused by unsupported customizations.
