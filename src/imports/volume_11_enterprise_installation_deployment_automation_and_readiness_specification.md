## 1. Installation Philosophy

Installation is not documentation support for engineering teams.  
Installation is a **product feature**.

A world-class enterprise product must support all of the following:

- guided setup for novice or evaluation users
- repeatable automation for DevOps teams
- secure deployment for regulated customers
- documented and testable upgrade and rollback paths
- observable readiness before production go-live

### World-class installation principle
The desired product experience is:

**Download → Run installer → Answer questions → Receive recommended architecture → Validate prerequisites → Install → Verify health → Review readiness score → Go live**

This is the approved installation experience standard.

Provide a premium, operator-friendly summary of how ready the deployment is for production.

### 13.2 Suggested scoring categories
- HTTPS/TLS enabled
- secure secret posture
- admin account created safely
- MFA/SSO configured
- database connectivity and backup posture
- object storage readiness
- queue readiness and dead-letter support
- monitoring configured
- audit logs enabled
- restore test completed
- HA posture enabled where required
- unsupported defaults removed

### 13.3 Example output
**Enterprise Readiness Score: 82/100**

Passed:
- HTTPS enabled
- database reachable
- health checks passing
- audit enabled

Needs attention:
- SSO not configured
- backup restore not tested
- HA not enabled
- queue alerting not configured

### 13.4 Operator action model
Each failing or warning control should map to:
- severity
- explanation
- remediation step
- whether it blocks production approval

---

## 14. Secure Default Configuration Standard

A world-class product must choose secure defaults.

### Mandatory defaults
- HTTPS required where applicable
- secure cookies enabled
- strong password policy or equivalent auth baseline
- dangerous dev/test defaults disabled in production mode
- admin creation flow protected
- secrets auto-generated where possible
- audit enabled by default
- backup guidance presented by default
- insecure public exposure blocked by default
- plugin/theme high-risk capabilities disabled until approved

### Principle
The product must not depend on the operator already knowing security best practices.

---

## 15. Backup, Restore, and Disaster Recovery Requirements

### 15.1 Backup requirements
The platform must document and, where feasible, assist with backup for:
- primary database
- essential config
- object metadata or storage mappings
- queue/config state where relevant
- audit retention surfaces
- plugin/theme configuration

### 15.2 Restore requirements
Restore guidance must define:
- expected data freshness
- preconditions
- validation after restore
- tenant impact
- follow-up checks

### 15.3 Disaster recovery
The product must define:
- RPO/RTO assumptions by deployment mode

Rollback guidance must define:
- when rollback is supported
- how to detect unsafe rollback scenarios
- migration reversibility boundaries
- post-rollback validation steps

### 16.4 Upgrade UX principle
A product installs well but upgrades badly is not world-class.  
Upgrade excellence is a core installability requirement.

---

- health-check failures

---

## 18. Production Readiness Checklist

A deployment is not production-ready until the following are true:

- selected deployment mode is supported
- required adapters validated
- services healthy
- admin baseline configured
- tenant context working
- audit enabled
- backup plan defined
- restore procedure known or tested
- monitoring and alert routing configured
- security warnings reviewed

## Final Principle

A world-class enterprise product is not one that only runs after expert effort.  
It is one that can be **installed safely, sized intelligently, automated repeatably, validated clearly, upgraded confidently, and operated trustworthily**.

Enterprise installability is not a support document.  
It is part of the product itself.
