# Multi-Tenant Product Platform Charter

Unified General Specification, Principles, and Mandatory Standards

Version 2.0 • Updated April 23, 2026

Purpose of this document: to define the mandatory standards for designing, building, operating, extending, publishing, installing, documenting, and supporting a world-class multi-tenant cloud product.

# 1. Purpose

This charter is the shared rulebook for product, design, engineering, architecture, security, privacy, legal, compliance, QA, DevOps/SRE, support, marketing/brand/web, and developer ecosystem teams.

It exists to protect tenant isolation, customer trust, legal and public credibility, product consistency, operational reliability, extensibility without chaos, upgrade safety, and long-term maintainability.

This document is not optional guidance. It is the minimum standard every team must follow.

# 2. Product Vision

The product must be built as a world-class multi-tenant SaaS platform that is:

- secure by default

- API-first

- enterprise-ready

- legally and publicly trustworthy

- globally deployable

- accessible and multilingual-ready

- operationally reliable

- installable where supported

- extensible through governed themes and plugins

- consistent across UI, API, documentation, public website, installation, and support surfaces

# 3. Platform Thesis

The platform is one coherent product serving many tenants.

It must operate as:

- one platform

- many isolated tenants

- controlled configurability

- explicit service ownership

- stable API contracts

- governed extension points

- publicly credible product and company presence

A multi-tenant platform is not only an architecture decision. It is a product model, security model, design model, legal model, operational model, and ecosystem model.

# 4. Non-Negotiable Principles

## 4.1 Tenant isolation first

No feature may weaken tenant isolation.

## 4.2 Secure by default

The safest behavior must be the default behavior.

## 4.3 Authentication before access; authorization before action

Every access must begin with verified identity and every action must be explicitly authorized.

## 4.4 One platform, governed customization

Tenants may configure supported settings, branding, themes, and policies, but the product must remain coherent and supportable.

## 4.5 Shared rules across all surfaces

Business rules must apply consistently across UI, API, automation, admin tools, plugins, themes, integrations, queue consumers, and background jobs.

## 4.6 Least privilege always

Users, admins, service accounts, plugins, support staff, and internal tooling must operate with minimum required access.

## 4.7 Auditability is a product requirement

Security-sensitive and business-critical actions must be attributable, reviewable, and exportable.

## 4.8 Public trust is part of the product

A serious cloud product must include brand, legal, privacy, trust, security, contact, and public documentation surfaces.

## 4.9 Global readiness by design

Localization, Unicode, time zones, accessibility, regional deployment, and legal discoverability must be planned from the beginning.

## 4.10 Operability defines completeness

A feature is not done unless it can be monitored, supported, debugged, audited, and recovered.

## 4.11 Service ownership must stay explicit

Every service owns its own business logic, data model, migrations, and operational boundaries.

## 4.12 Extensibility must remain safe

Themes and plugins must never bypass security, legal, design, or service boundaries.

## 4.13 Messaging must remain governed

Async processing must preserve tenant boundaries, service boundaries, retry safety, and observability.

# 5. Platform Scope

The platform must support:

- multiple tenants

- multiple organizations, teams, or workspaces inside a tenant

- tenant-level configuration

- role-based and policy-based access

- strong authentication and secure sessions

- service accounts and integrations

- subscriptions, plans, and entitlements

- audit trails and observability

- localization and accessibility

- regional controls where required

- public website and legal trust surfaces

- installation and deployment flows where supported

- developer portal, APIs, themes, and plugin ecosystem

- configurable messaging and queue infrastructure

# 6. Tenant Model

## 6.1 Definition

A tenant is a logically isolated customer environment within the platform.

## 6.2 Required tenant attributes

- unique tenant ID

- legal/customer name

- display name

- plan or subscription

- enabled entitlements

- region and residency settings

- locale and language defaults

- branding and theme settings

- security settings

- auth and SSO settings

- usage quotas

- lifecycle status

- audit scope

## 6.3 Tenant lifecycle

The platform must support tenant creation, onboarding, activation, suspension, reactivation, plan upgrade or downgrade, offboarding, and export and deletion workflows where contractually applicable.

## 6.4 Isolation requirement

All data, storage, caches, queues, topics, search results, indexes, audit events, reports, analytics, and background jobs must respect tenant boundaries. Every persistent object must be explicitly tenant-scoped or deterministically mapped to tenant context.

# 7. Organization, Identity, and Role Model

## 7.1 Supported actors

- platform admins

- internal operations roles

- tenant admins

- organization or business-unit admins

- workspace or project admins where relevant

- standard end users

- read-only or auditor roles

- external collaborators where explicitly allowed

- service accounts or machine identities

- plugin identities where applicable

## 7.2 Admin hierarchy

The system must clearly separate Platform Admin, Tenant Admin, Organization or Business Unit Admin, Security Admin, Compliance or Audit Admin, Billing or Subscription Admin, and Developer or Integration Admin.

## 7.3 Role design rules

Roles must be minimal, predictable, documented, testable, non-overlapping where possible, and resistant to role explosion. Prefer standard roles plus composable permissions over ad hoc special roles.

# 8. Authentication Specification

## 8.1 Supported authentication

- username/password where allowed

- SSO via SAML and/or OIDC

- MFA

- password reset and recovery flows

- passwordless where appropriate

- machine or service authentication

- short-lived token-based access

## 8.2 MFA

MFA must be supported and enforceable at platform or tenant level. Sensitive operations should support step-up authentication.

## 8.3 Session management

Sessions must be revocable, time-bounded, auditable, protected from replay and fixation, and device or session aware where appropriate.

Default guidance:

- idle timeout: 15 to 30 minutes for admin contexts

- absolute timeout: 8 to 12 hours configurable per tenant

- re-authentication for critical actions

- logout-all-sessions support

- suspicious session invalidation

## 8.4 Credential handling

Secrets must never be logged or exposed in client code. Passwords must be strongly hashed. Long-lived credentials should be avoided.

## 8.5 Tenant-aware login

Authentication UX must make tenant context clear through tenant-aware routing, branded login where supported, visible organization identity, safe fallback flows, and clear error messaging without information leakage.

# 9. Authorization Specification

## 9.1 Model

The default authorization model should combine RBAC for common roles, ABAC for contextual control, and policy-based rules for enterprise needs.

## 9.2 Authorization layers

Permissions must be enforceable at platform level, tenant level, organization or workspace level, resource level, action level, and field or attribute level where needed.

## 9.3 Sensitive actions requiring explicit authorization

- changing tenant settings

- managing users and roles

- exporting data

- external sharing

- editing policies

- deleting records

- changing billing or entitlements

- impersonation or support access

- viewing security or compliance data

- plugin install, enable, disable, or upgrade

- theme publish

- installation or bootstrap actions

- queue adapter reconfiguration

- replaying or reprocessing async jobs or events

## 9.4 No frontend-only enforcement

The frontend may hide controls for UX clarity, but the backend must enforce all real permissions.

# 10. Subscription, Entitlements, and Feature Control

## 10.1 Core rule

The following must remain separate:

- plan = commercial packaging

- entitlement = features the tenant may use

- configuration = how features behave

- authorization = which user may do what

## 10.2 Required controls

The platform must support plan-based feature access, usage-based quotas, feature flags, premium modules, trial status, tenant-specific enablement, and downgrade or upgrade behavior.

## 10.3 Downgrade behavior

When plans or entitlements change, data must not be silently lost, admins must be warned, safe read-only states should exist where possible, and contract, export, deletion, and retention obligations must be respected.

# 11. Design and UX Specification

## 11.1 Core design principles

The product must be clear, consistent, role-aware, enterprise-grade, scalable from simple to advanced workflows, and safe for admin and destructive actions.

## 11.2 Design system

All teams must use one shared design system covering typography, spacing, layout and grid, colors, tokens, icons, components, forms, tables, navigation, empty states, validation states, destructive flows, and accessibility behavior.

## 11.3 UX rules

Every screen must show clear tenant context, make permission consequences understandable, show current state clearly, support error recovery, and preserve trust in admin, security, and audit views.

## 11.4 Accessibility

Accessibility is mandatory. The platform should meet WCAG 2.1 AA or better.

## 11.5 Localization

The product must be localization-ready:

- no hardcoded UI strings

- support long translations

- support locale-aware formatting

## 12.2 Theme capabilities

Supported theming may include logo, favicon, color tokens, typography within approved bounds, light/dark mode support, icon and illustration packs where approved, branded login, email or template branding, and footer branding where contractually allowed.

## 12.3 Theme boundaries

Themes must not allow arbitrary code execution, arbitrary script injection, broken accessibility, design system bypass, security-critical UX changes, or removal of required legal or footer elements.

## 12.4 Theme system rules

The theme architecture must be token-based, versioned, validated, previewable, reversible, rollback-friendly, and accessibility-safe.

## 14.3 Privacy principles

The platform must disclose data handling clearly, minimize unnecessary collection, support lawful processing expectations, support deletion, export, and access workflows where relevant, and distinguish product data from analytics or marketing data.

## 14.4 Claims management

Security, compliance, privacy, AI, and availability claims must be accurate, reviewable, and approved.

# 15. Data Governance Principles

## 15.1 Data ownership

Tenant or customer data belongs to the tenant or customer subject to contract and law.

## 15.2 Classification

- source-download or source-available installation model, if part of the business model

If the product supports installation by customers or partners, installation is a first-class product surface.

## 16.2 Mandatory installation page

The public website or documentation must include an Installation page where applicable. It must provide deployment models, prerequisites, supported environments, source or package download path if applicable, install guide, configuration guide, upgrade guide, rollback guidance, security hardening recommendations, version compatibility matrix, checksums or integrity verification where relevant, and license or legal usage terms for installable editions.

## 16.3 Installation-first design rule

No feature may assume hidden infrastructure dependencies that cannot be configured or documented.

# 17. First-Run Configuration Requirements

## 17.1 Mandatory first-run setup flow

On first installation or bootstrap, the operator must be guided through configuration of at minimum:

- CDN

- Database adapter selection: MySQL or PostgreSQL

- Object storage: S3 or S3-compatible storage

- Cache: Redis

- Queue or Messaging adapter: SQS, Kafka, or RabbitMQ

## 17.2 Setup experience

The platform should provide a setup experience through installation wizard, bootstrap UI, CLI, or structured setup API. The setup flow must validate configuration, test connectivity, fail safely, provide retry guidance, prevent partial invalid initialization, and record configuration state safely.

## 17.3 Required setup categories

## 17.5 Optional modules

Additional optional setup may include SMTP or email, SSO or IdP, monitoring or alerting integrations, webhook signing keys, analytics settings, backup configuration, and KMS or secret manager integration.

# 18. Service-Oriented Architecture Principles

## 18.1 Services approach is mandatory

The platform must follow a service-oriented architecture from the beginning.

## 18.2 Service boundaries

Each service must own its domain, business rules, persistence model, migrations, APIs or events, observability, and runbooks. No service may directly own another service’s business logic.

## 18.3 Example service domains

Examples may include:

- identity service

- tenant service

- billing service

- audit service

- document service

- workflow service

- notification service

- search or indexing service

- policy service

- installation or configuration service

- plugin service

- theme service

- developer portal service

- queue or messaging service

# 19. Database Ownership and Table Naming Rules

## 19.1 Database ownership

Each service must own its own tables and schema responsibility.

## 19.2 Table naming convention

Every service must prefix its tables with the service name.

Examples:

- identity_users

- identity_sessions

- tenant_tenants

- tenant_settings

- document_documents

- document_versions

- audit_events

- billing_subscriptions

- plugin_plugins

- theme_themes

- queue_messages

- queue_consumers

## 19.3 No cross-service SQL joins

No SQL statement may join another service’s tables directly.

## 19.4 No shared mutable tables

Two or more services must not jointly own the same mutable table.

## 19.5 Migration ownership

Each service manages only its own migrations. No service may alter another service’s tables.

## 19.6 Cross-service references

Cross-service foreign keys should be avoided. If a service references another service entity, it should store the external identifier as a value, not a tightly coupled relational dependency.

# 20. Cross-Service Communication and Read Model Rules

## 20.1 Approved cross-service methods

Cross-service interaction must happen through:

- service APIs

- internal RPC where approved

- domain events

- async messaging

- materialized read models

- reporting pipelines

- workflow or event orchestration

## 20.2 Query composition

If a UI or API needs combined data from multiple services, composition must happen through backend aggregation layer, API gateway or BFF, query orchestrator, prebuilt read model, or analytics or reporting store. It must not happen through direct database joins across services.

## 20.3 Reporting and analytics

Cross-domain reporting is allowed only through ETL or ELT pipelines, warehouse or reporting database, search projection layer, or materialized views generated from service-owned sources.

## 20.4 Caching boundaries

Caches must respect tenant boundaries, service ownership, invalidation ownership, and unambiguous cache keys.

# 21. Queue and Messaging Architecture Specification

## 21.1 Purpose

The platform must support a configurable queue and messaging layer from the beginning.

## 21.2 Supported adapters

The product must support choosing one of:

- AWS SQS

- Apache Kafka

- RabbitMQ

## 21.3 Queue service responsibilities

The queue or messaging abstraction layer must handle async job dispatch, event delivery, retry handling, dead-letter handling, backoff strategy, message durability expectations, consumer group or subscriber coordination, queue or topic naming conventions, observability and tracing, and tenant-safe processing behavior.

## 21.4 Queue abstraction principle

Application services must not hardcode themselves directly to one queue provider unless explicitly approved. A platform-level messaging abstraction should exist so services can publish and consume through stable internal contracts while the infrastructure adapter maps to SQS, Kafka, or RabbitMQ semantics.

## 21.5 Queue naming rules

Queue, topic, exchange, and routing names must follow explicit naming conventions and should include environment, service name, and domain or event or job type.

## 21.6 Tenant and service boundaries

Messaging must preserve tenant boundaries, service ownership, auditability of critical async actions, retry safety, and idempotency where required. No queue consumer may process a message outside its authorized service boundary.

## 21.7 Messaging patterns

The platform may support both command or job processing and domain event publishing. Teams must explicitly define which pattern is being used.

## 21.8 Reliability requirements

The queue layer must support retry policy, dead-letter queues or topics or exchanges, poison message handling, replay strategy where supported, idempotent consumers where required, consumer lag or backlog visibility, and alerting for failed or stuck processing.

## 21.9 Plugin and extension compatibility

If plugins can subscribe to platform events or async workflows, plugin integration with the queue system must only happen through approved extension points and event contracts.

# 22. Developer Portal Specification

## 22.1 Purpose

The platform must include a first-class Developer Portal. It is a product surface, not just documentation.

## 22.2 Required capabilities

The Developer Portal must include:

- API reference

- endpoint catalog

- auth and authorization guide

- tenant context guide

- SDK docs

- webhook and event reference

- plugin development guide

- theme customization guide

- installation guide

- changelog or release notes

- versioning and deprecation policy

- sample apps or starter kits

- sandbox or test guidance

- error code catalog

- rate-limit guidance

- support and escalation path

## 22.3 Portal principles

The Developer Portal must be versioned, searchable, accurate, maintained as part of release, and permission-aware for private or internal content.

## 22.4 Developer experience rule

No externally consumable capability is complete without docs, example requests and responses, auth requirements, permission implications, version notes, failure behavior, and rate-limit notes where relevant.

# 23. API Endpoint and Contract Specification

## 23.1 Core rule

The platform must define and maintain a governed API surface.

## 23.2 API domains

At minimum, endpoint groups should exist for:

- authentication

- sessions

- tenants

- organizations or workspaces

- users and groups

- roles and permissions

- subscriptions or entitlements

- settings and configuration

- installation or bootstrap

- themes or branding

- plugins

- developer keys or service accounts

- audit events

- webhooks or events

- health or readiness

- queue or messaging management

- business services

## 23.3 Required endpoint definition

Every endpoint must define purpose, method, path, auth requirement, tenant scope, permission requirement, request schema, response schema, validation behavior, error codes, rate-limit class, and audit behavior for writes.

## 23.4 Naming principles

Endpoints must be predictable, resource-based, versioned, consistent in naming, and separated by domain ownership.

## 23.5 Tenant-aware API rule

Every endpoint must explicitly define tenant-scope behavior. No endpoint may operate with ambiguous tenant context.

## 23.6 Example endpoint groups

Typical shapes include /api/v1/auth/*, /api/v1/tenants/*, /api/v1/users/*, /api/v1/roles/*, /api/v1/service-accounts/*, /api/v1/audit/events, /api/v1/settings/theme, /api/v1/plugins/*, /api/v1/install/*, and /api/v1/queue/*.

## 23.7 API governance

A new API may not ship unless ownership, version strategy, permission model, documentation, tests, audit behavior, and backward compatibility review are complete.

# 24. Plugin Architecture Specification

## 24.1 Purpose

The platform must support a plugin architecture so that others can write plugins and deploy them in a governed way.

## 24.2 Plugin principles

Plugins must be explicitly permissioned, versioned, isolated, observable, installable, enableable or disableable, auditable, upgrade-aware, and tenant-aware.

## 24.3 Supported plugin categories

Possible plugin types include:

- UI extension plugins

- workflow plugins

- event handler plugins

- integration connector plugins

- validation plugins

- notification plugins

- reporting or export plugins

- theme extension packs

- developer tooling plugins

## 24.4 Plugin boundaries

Plugins must only use approved extension points. They must not directly query arbitrary service databases, bypass business rules, bypass tenant scope, execute privileged actions without declared permissions, alter another service’s schema, inject unsafe code into shared runtime without isolation, or break upgrade compatibility silently.

## 24.5 Deployment model

Plugin deployment must support packaging, signature or integrity verification where applicable, compatibility checks, install validation, enable or disable control, rollback, version pinning, lifecycle events, and audit records.

## 24.6 Plugin isolation

Plugins must run in an isolated model appropriate to risk, such as sandboxed runtime, sidecar or worker model, extension host, or remote API or webhook-driven execution model.

## 24.7 Plugin manifest

Every plugin must declare:

- name

- owner

- version

- supported product versions

- required permissions

- required extension points

- config schema

- runtime dependencies

- tenant scope behavior

- audit or event behavior

## 24.8 Plugin permission model

Plugin permissions must be reviewable, consented to by admins, revocable, and auditable.

## 24.9 Distribution models

Plugins may be platform-managed, tenant-installed, partner-distributed, or marketplace-distributed. All models must preserve ownership clarity, support boundaries, and lifecycle control.

# 25. Plugin Development and Deployment Rules

## 25.1 Third-party development

The platform must provide an official model for plugin development, including SDK or plugin framework, manifest specification, packaging format, local development workflow, testing harness, example plugins, compatibility guidance, and publishing or install guide.

## 25.2 Standard deployment flow

A standard plugin flow should include build, package, validate, sign or checksum, upload or register, compatibility check, configure, enable, monitor, and disable or rollback.

## 25.3 Release safety

Plugins must not be activated without compatibility validation, permission review, admin approval, observability hooks, and audit registration.

## 25.4 Upgrade rules

Plugin upgrades must support version compatibility checks, safe migration guidance, rollback path, deprecation handling, and health visibility.

# 26. Theme and Plugin Boundary Rules

## 26.1 Plugins must respect service ownership

Plugins may use published APIs, extension hooks, events, plugin SDKs, and stable service contracts. Plugins must not directly join or manipulate cross-service tables.

## 26.2 Themes must respect product boundaries

Themes may alter approved presentation tokens and assets, but must not override authorization behavior, required legal disclosures, required footer items, security-critical labels, or audit visibility rules.

## 26.3 Explicit extension points

Every service that supports extension must define explicit extension points such as before-create, after-create, validation hook, notification hook, export hook, workflow transition hook, UI slot, and event subscription.

# 27. Security Requirements

## 27.1 Baseline controls

The platform must provide:

- encryption in transit

- encryption at rest

- centralized secret management

- strong auth and session controls

- role or policy enforcement

- audit logs

## 27.2 Logging and audit

Critical events must be logged, including auth events, session events, permission changes, admin actions, policy changes, exports, deletion events, sharing events, billing and entitlement changes, support access, plugin lifecycle actions, theme publish actions, installation or bootstrap actions, queue adapter selection or reconfiguration, and message replay or redrive operations where applicable.

## 27.3 Internal access

Internal staff access must be tightly controlled, logged, and minimized.

# 28. Operational Principles and Measurable NFRs

## 28.1 Availability

Default target:

- 99.9 percent minimum for core service

- 99.95 percent target for enterprise-grade availability

## 28.2 Performance

Baseline expectations:

- p95 interactive API latency under 300 to 500 ms for common reads

- p95 auth or session validation under 150 ms

- p95 search or list actions under 2 seconds for standard tenant workloads

## 28.3 Recovery

Default targets:

- RPO: 15 minutes or better for critical systems

- RTO: 4 hours or better for critical systems

## 28.4 Audit retention

Audit retention must be explicitly defined per product and plan.

## 28.5 Monitoring

Every critical service must emit logs, metrics, traces, health status, and alerts with actionable ownership.

## 28.6 Noisy-neighbor protection

The platform must protect tenants from each other using rate limits, quotas, queue fairness, consumer concurrency controls, and storage and compute boundaries.

# 29. Incident, Support, and Operational Ownership

## 29.1 Ownership model

Each domain must have a defined owner:

- auth

- authorization

- tenant model

- audit

- data lifecycle

- integrations

- public website and legal content

- reliability

- incident response

- developer portal

- theme system

- plugin platform

- installation and bootstrap

# 33. Product, Design, Marketing, and Ecosystem Rules

## 33.1 One consistent story

Public website, product UI, documentation, developer portal, legal pages, installation guides, and support material must tell a consistent story.

## 33.2 Design must support credibility

Public pages, footer structure, trust pages, legal layouts, and developer surfaces are part of the product experience.

## 33.3 No incomplete public presence

A serious cloud product must never launch publicly with missing Terms, missing Privacy Policy, missing Contact details, broken footer discoverability, unsupported trust claims, or unclear company identity.

## 33.4 Brand, legal, trust, documentation, install, and developer surfaces are not extras

They are required parts of the product system.

# 34. Reference Architecture and Deployment Standard

## 34.1 Purpose

The platform must maintain a reference architecture that defines the approved structural model for managed SaaS deployments, private cloud deployments, self-hosted deployments, regional deployments, high-availability and disaster recovery topologies, and installation and upgrade paths.

## 34.2 Required architecture views

The platform must maintain current architecture documentation for:

- logical architecture

- service architecture

- network and trust boundaries

- identity and auth architecture

- data flow architecture

- event and queue architecture

- deployment topology

- observability architecture

- extension and plugin runtime architecture

- backup and disaster recovery architecture

## 34.3 Deployment patterns

Approved deployment patterns must be defined for single-region standard deployment, multi-region enterprise deployment, private cloud deployment, self-hosted deployment, and air-gapped or restricted-network variants if supported.

## 34.4 Trust boundaries

The reference architecture must explicitly identify public ingress boundaries, internal service boundaries, data storage boundaries, tenant isolation boundaries, admin or support access boundaries, plugin execution boundaries, and third-party integration boundaries.

## 34.5 Architecture review requirement

Any material deviation from the reference architecture must undergo formal review by architecture, security, and operations owners.

# 35. Security Threat Model and Abuse Case Standard

## 35.1 Purpose

The platform must maintain a living threat model covering product, infrastructure, tenant isolation, integrations, installation, themes, plugins, and operational tooling.

## 35.2 Required threat domains

The threat model must address at minimum:

- cross-tenant data leakage

- privilege escalation

- broken authorization

- compromised credentials

- session hijacking or replay

- API abuse

- insecure admin or support tooling

- plugin abuse

- unsafe theme injection

- queue or message poisoning

- event replay abuse

- insecure installation or bootstrap

- data exfiltration

- destructive admin misuse

- supply chain compromise

- insider threat

- log or audit tampering

## 35.3 Abuse case catalog

The platform must maintain an abuse case catalog with scenarios such as tenant A seeing tenant B data, a low-privilege user escalating to tenant admin, a plugin reading unauthorized tenant data, a support user bypassing approval flow, a replayed async message causing duplicate destructive actions, a self-hosted operator misconfiguring security defaults, a theme removing security warnings or legal links, and an integration exporting excessive data without proper audit.

## 35.4 Required outputs

Each threat or abuse case must map to affected assets, attacker profile, likelihood, impact, mitigations, detection strategy, test approach, and owner.

## 35.5 Review cadence

Threat model and abuse case review must occur before major releases, when adding new extension surfaces, when adding new infrastructure adapters, when adding new deployment modes, and after major incidents.

# 36. Data Modeling and Persistence Standard

## 36.1 Purpose

The platform must follow one shared data modeling standard across all services.

## 36.2 Required field conventions

Every primary persistent entity should define consistent conventions for ID, tenant ID where applicable, created_at, updated_at, created_by where applicable, updated_by where applicable, status or state, version or revision where applicable, soft delete marker where applicable, and audit correlation identifier where relevant.

## 36.3 ID standard

The platform must define one standard for identifiers across services, including format, sortability expectations if applicable, external versus internal ID usage, collision requirements, and human exposure policy.

## 36.4 Timestamp standard

All services must store timestamps consistently in UTC and render them according to tenant or user locale in presentation layers.

## 36.5 State modeling

State transitions must be explicit and validated. Hidden magic states are prohibited.

## 36.6 Soft delete and hard delete

The charter must define when soft delete is allowed, when hard delete is required, how legal hold or retention affects delete behavior, restore rules, and audit implications.

## 36.7 Versioning

Entities that affect compliance, integrations, extension behavior, or customer-visible contract should support versioning where appropriate, including schemas, policies, themes, plugins, installation manifests, and API contracts.

## 36.8 Data ownership

Every table, stream, topic, cache namespace, and search index must have a clearly documented owner.

## 36.9 Persistence review rule

A new persistent entity may not ship without ownership, lifecycle definition, audit implications, deletion rules, migration plan, and tenant scope behavior.

# 37. API Governance and Compatibility Standard

## 37.1 Purpose

The platform must govern APIs as product contracts, not as implementation byproducts.

## 37.2 Required API standards

Every API must conform to platform-wide standards for naming, versioning, pagination, filtering, sorting, error envelope, authentication, authorization, rate limiting, idempotency, tracing or correlation, audit behavior, deprecation, and backward compatibility.

## 37.3 Pagination standard

All list endpoints must use a standard pagination model and document default page size, maximum page size, token or page-number strategy, and sort stability expectations.

## 37.4 Error standard

The platform must define one standard response model for errors, including machine-readable code, human-readable message, retryability hint where relevant, correlation ID, and validation details where relevant.

## 37.5 Idempotency standard

All create or mutation endpoints with retry risk must define idempotency behavior.

## 37.6 Backward compatibility policy

The platform must define what counts as a breaking change, supported version window, deprecation notice policy, migration guidance requirements, and sunset communication standards.

## 37.7 Public vs private APIs

The charter must distinguish public supported APIs, partner or private APIs, and internal-only APIs.

## 37.8 API review requirement

A new or modified API may not ship without design review, schema review, permission review, compatibility review, documentation, example requests and responses, and monitoring plan.

# 38. SLO, SLI, and Service Operations Standard

## 38.1 Purpose

The platform must define service quality as measurable commitments, not vague aspirations.

## 38.2 Required service indicators

Each critical service must define SLIs for availability, latency, error rate, saturation or capacity, queue lag where applicable, and background job completion where applicable.

## 38.3 Required SLO ownership

Each service must have target SLOs, alert thresholds, error budget owner, remediation expectations, and reporting cadence.

## 38.4 Minimum service runbook

Each service must have a runbook including purpose, dependencies, key dashboards, common failure modes, alerts, rollback guidance, recovery steps, and escalation contacts.

## 38.5 Customer-impacting event thresholds

The platform must define thresholds for degraded service, partial outage, full outage, tenant-specific incident, dependency outage, and queue processing backlog incident.

## 38.6 Operational maturity rule

A service is not production-ready unless it has SLOs, dashboards, alerts, a runbook, ownership, and failure testing or incident rehearsal evidence.

# 39. Tenant Isolation Verification Standard

## 39.1 Purpose

Tenant isolation must be actively proven, not assumed.

## 39.2 Required verification layers

Isolation testing must exist at API level, service level, persistence layer, cache layer, search and index layer, queue and async processing layer, analytics and reporting layer, admin and support tooling layer, and plugin and extension layer.

## 39.3 Mandatory test classes

At minimum the platform must maintain:

- unit tests for tenant scoping

- integration tests for auth and authz boundaries

- end-to-end tests for cross-tenant access prevention

- regression tests for admin and support actions

- queue and event routing isolation tests

- search result trimming tests

- cache namespace collision tests

- report export isolation tests

## 39.4 Security validation

The platform should also support red-team style reviews, fuzz testing for scope leaks, chaos or fault injection for degraded auth or context states, and periodic privileged access audits.

## 39.5 Release gate

Any release affecting auth, authorization, search, queues, reporting, plugins, support access, or tenancy logic must pass isolation verification.

# 40. Plugin, Theme, and Extension Security Standard

## 40.1 Purpose

The extension model must be governed as a security boundary.

## 40.2 Sandbox requirement

The platform must define an approved execution model for plugins, such as isolated runtime, sidecar worker, extension host, or remote callback model. The chosen model must explicitly address filesystem access, network access, memory or process isolation, secret handling, resource quotas, crash containment, tenant scoping, and audit visibility.

## 40.3 Secret handling

Plugins must never receive unrestricted platform secrets. Any secret access must be scoped, approved, revocable, and auditable.

## 40.4 Event and hook governance

Hooks and event subscriptions must be explicitly documented, versioned, permissioned, stability-rated, and observable.

## 40.5 Theme security

Themes must not be able to suppress required compliance text, remove legal discoverability, alter security-critical flows, mislead users about environment or tenant identity, or hide warnings, audit cues, or permission state.

## 40.6 Extension review process

All new extension points must undergo architecture review, security review, product review, supportability review, and versioning review.

# 41. Support, Break-Glass, and Internal Access Standard

## 41.1 Purpose

Internal access to customer environments is a trust boundary and must be tightly controlled.

## 41.2 Break-glass policy

The platform must define a formal break-glass process for urgent access, including approved use cases, approval chain, duration limit, least-privilege mode, session recording or equivalent audit where possible, and post-access review.

## 41.3 Support tooling rules

Support tooling must require explicit tenant selection, show clear impact scope, enforce role checks, log all sensitive access, support temporary elevation only, and prevent silent impersonation.

## 41.4 Customer-visible transparency

Where contractually or operationally appropriate, the platform should support customer visibility into privileged access events.

## 41.5 Internal role separation

The platform must distinguish operational support, billing support, security response, engineering debugging, and production admin access.

# 42. Compliance Control Matrix and Evidence Standard

## 42.1 Purpose

The platform must connect product controls to compliance expectations in a structured way.

## 42.2 Required mapping areas

The product should maintain control mapping coverage for relevant frameworks such as SOC 2, ISO 27001, GDPR, HIPAA where applicable, PCI DSS where applicable, and regional privacy laws where applicable.

## 42.3 Product vs organizational control boundary

The charter must distinguish controls implemented by the product, controls implemented by platform operations, controls implemented by customer configuration, and controls requiring legal or business process support.

## 42.4 Evidence readiness

The platform must define how it produces or supports evidence for auth controls, access reviews, audit logs, retention rules, deletion and export handling, admin changes, incident records, backup and recovery tests, and plugin installation and permission approvals.

## 42.5 Compliance representation rule

No compliance claim may be made publicly unless the underlying control ownership and evidence path are clear.

# 43. Upgrade, Migration, and Compatibility Policy

## 43.1 Purpose

A world-class platform must be safe to upgrade, migrate, and roll back.

## 43.2 Required upgrade policy

The platform must define supported upgrade paths, minimum supported previous versions, rollback expectations, compatibility windows, migration prerequisites, and required backup posture before upgrade.

## 43.3 Self-hosted upgrade standard

If self-hosted or source-installed deployment is supported, the platform must publish upgrade guide, version compatibility matrix, migration notes, deprecated feature notices, schema migration behavior, plugin compatibility expectations, theme compatibility expectations, and queue adapter migration guidance where relevant.

## 43.4 Migration safety

Data migrations must be testable, observable, resumable where possible, reversible or recoverable where appropriate, and documented for operators.

## 43.5 Extension compatibility

Plugins and themes must declare compatibility with product versions. Unsupported combinations must fail safely.

# 44. Capacity, Cost, and Scale Guardrails

## 44.1 Purpose

A best-in-class product must be economically sustainable and operationally predictable at scale.

## 44.2 Required capacity planning

The platform must define planning and monitoring for storage growth, query volume, auth load, queue throughput, background job concurrency, plugin runtime resource usage, CDN usage, tenant concentration risk, and noisy-neighbor risk.

## 44.3 Cost-aware architecture

Teams must consider storage amplification, search indexing cost, event retention cost, queue replay cost, plugin execution cost, cross-region transfer cost, and self-hosted support burden.

## 44.4 Scale review trigger

A feature must undergo scale and cost review when it materially affects storage, indexing, messaging, cross-service fan-out, multi-region replication, plugin runtime volume, or reporting or export load.

# 45. Marketplace and Distribution Governance Standard

## 45.1 Purpose

If plugins, themes, templates, or extension packs are distributed through a marketplace or partner channel, that channel must be governed.

## 45.2 Required governance areas

The marketplace model must define publisher identity verification, package review rules, compatibility checks, permission disclosure, support ownership, takedown or revocation process, update policy, legal or license policy, and security response process.

## 45.3 Customer safety requirements

Customers must be able to see who published the extension, what permissions it requires, what versions it supports, what data it can access, how to disable or remove it, and who supports it.

## 45.4 Revocation and emergency response

The platform must support revoking or disabling unsafe extensions in a controlled, auditable way.

# 47. Final Principle

A multi-tenant product is only world-class when it is trustworthy at every layer:

- architecture

- service ownership

- authentication

- authorization

- data modeling

- API governance

- design

- public brand

- legal transparency

- installation

- upgrade safety

- queue and messaging
